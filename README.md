## Purpose of the Symposium

Language is one of the most fundamental systems reflecting human intelligence and culture. Unlike large language models that require massive datasets and computational resources, humans acquire language efficiently from limited experience.

This symposium focused on:

* Cultural universals and diversity in human language
* Language acquisition and processing across cultures
* Interdisciplinary perspectives from computational science, neuroscience, and psychology

Key research themes included:

* Speech motor development
* Statistical learning mechanisms
* Speech perception
* Neural synchronization

The discussions aimed to uncover common learning principles and diverse developmental processes across different linguistic and cultural environments.
